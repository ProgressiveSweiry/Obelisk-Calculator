## Obelisk Haskell

Obelisk allows you to build high-quality web and mobile applications very quickly using Reflex. In minutes you can go from an empty directory to an interactive application that works on web, iOS, and Android, all sharing the same Haskell codebase! Obelisk's development environment also enables extremely rapid development and feedback. You can take advantage of Haskell's type system across the frontend and backend boundary. This means changes to your backend that would break your frontend are immediately detected during development and vice versa. Obelisk uses Haskell's compiler to give you a complete "TODO list" of what needs to be updated.

Obelisk is targeted primarily at Haskell developers who want to build high-quality web and/or mobile applications in Haskell, without the distractions of manually choosing and integrating technology for every piece of the system.

# Building The Project
Using Obelisk to build the project is quiet simple and interactive (you can change the script while running Obelisk server)
<br>
<br>
Clone the repository to your machine (Linux)
```
git clone https://github.com/ProgressiveSweiry/Obelisk-Calculator.git
```
Inside the calculator folder run Obelisk
```
cd calculator
ob run
```

# Calculator Project and modifications

This calculator project is taken from https://github.com/obsidiansystems/calculator-tutorial

### Modifications :
- Project is complete and ready to run with Obelisk configurations
- Updated with some libraries
- Some notes for functions declarations data types etc...
- Tutorial3 now use hash function SHA3_512 to hash given text
